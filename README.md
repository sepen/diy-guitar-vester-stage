# Vester Stage Series I – Guitar Restoration Project

## General Description

This guitar is a **Vester Stage Series I**, manufactured in Korea by **Saehan Guitar Technology**, likely around **1992–1993**. These models were part of the final and most refined era of Vester production before the brand was discontinued in the mid-90s. Vester guitars from this period are well-regarded for their quality, especially those made in Korea during the late '80s and early '90s.

This particular model features a **Super Strat-style body**, a **sharp Jackson-style headstock**, and an **active electronics system**, making it a rare and versatile instrument with both vintage character and aggressive performance features.

## Current Condition & Restoration Plan

I acquired this guitar in **heavily worn condition**, missing several critical parts and showing signs of neglect and poor modifications over the years. Here is a breakdown of the current state:

- **Missing bone nut**: The original nut is completely gone.
- **Bridge issues**: Two of the tremolo system screws are missing, and the **backplate for the bridge cavity** is also absent.
- **Knobs**: Two of the three control knobs were missing.
- **Bridge pickup**: Had been forcibly removed from its base, wires cut and mounting hardware lost.
- **Finish**: The body had been repainted in a psychedelic style, but the finish was poorly done, with uneven texture and visible brush marks.
- **Binding**: The **white binding** on both the **neck and headstock** is damaged in multiple spots.
- **Fingerboard**: The fretboard is **partially unglued** near the nut, lifting slightly and requiring regluing and clamping.
- **Fret inlays**: Several decorative fretboard inlays are coming loose.
- **Body lamination**: On the back of the body, there's evidence of **delamination** between wooden layers or veneer separation.

## Restoration Vision

My goal is to **bring this instrument back to life** while preserving its unique vintage character and original components wherever possible. Here's my approach:

- **Wood repair**: I’ll carefully re-glue and refinish all damaged wooden sections, including the body lamination and fretboard.
- **Refinishing**: Ideally, I’d like to restore its **original cream finish**. However, if this proves unfeasible, I may opt to **strip the paint and highlight the natural wood grain** with a transparent or satin finish.
- **Part recovery**: I’ll attempt to **rebuild or source missing hardware** (e.g., nut, screws, knobs, backplate) using vintage-style parts or custom fabrication if needed.
- **Originality vs. improvement**: My aim is to **retain as many original elements as possible**, but I’m open to implementing **modern upgrades** where necessary — especially in areas where original parts are unsalvageable or compromise playability or sound quality.

This restoration is not just a repair — it's a respectful revival of a rare Korean-made guitar with unique features and vintage soul.
